Hi there! :smile:

I'm a Computer Engineering student passionate about coding and solving problems!

I guess I've recently found what is, potentially, my favourite programming language: Javascript.

I'm studying all of the wonderful things about: Javascript(ES6+), ReactJS, Node, CSS3 and, also, Python and C++.
Besides, I enjoy Algorithms and Data Structures and all the whole thing about Competitive programming.
