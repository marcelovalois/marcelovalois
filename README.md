Hi there! :smile:

I'm a Computer Engineering student passionated about coding and, solving problems!

I guess I've found what is, potentially, my favourite programming language: Javascript. :)

I'm studying all about the wonderful world of Javascript, ReactJS, Node, CSS3, Python, C++ and everything else!
